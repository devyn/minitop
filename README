                    version   0.1   ALPHA

So, basically, MiniTop is a home page. But not just any homepage, it's an /extendable/ homepage.
What does that mean, exactly? Well, I'll show you an example MiniPart.
    Consider the following ZIP file:
      example.part
       |-- description.yml
       |-- part.erb
       |-- res/
           |-- icon.png

description.yml is a YAML map. An example would be:
    ---
    name: Example App
That's all you need.

part.erb is a template, where the actual interface/code goes for your app. Example:
    <strong><%= "This is an example.".upcase %></strong><br/>

res/icon.png is your icon. It must be 24x24 or it will be resized.

* Running the MiniTop
Run:
  $ script/server
Then go to http://localhost:3000/
